## Checklist
* Make sure app successfully [builds and tests are passing](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/pitchfork#build) before opening a new PR.
* Update existing tests and/or add new tests if needed. It's always a good idea to add unit/integration tests for any non-trivial changes.
* Update the documentation if needed.
